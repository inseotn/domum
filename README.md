Game developed by the Warriors Women in Game (WWG) team during the Women Game Jam 2021


The theme of the Jam: “Navigating in Unknown Waters”

The subject is chosen by the team: "Difficulties of refugees and the hospitality and welcome they find in Brazil"

We were inspired by two members of the team who are refugees and found their new home in Brazil. We were also inspired by the book “The tale of the unknown island” by José Saramago


According to data released by the National Committee for Refugees (CONARE) in the 6th edition of the report “Refúgio em Números”, at the end of 2020, there were 57,099 recognized refugees in Brazil.
